 # Developer Salary 2023
This project is to predict the Salary of Developers in various countries. Features such as Country, Years of Experience, Educational background or level and its remote, hybrid or On-site role would be used to determine the salaries. This model can be instrumental to both developers seeking out opportunities and also for Hiring managers looking to get there next talent. 

This project is to improve my last Developer Salary prediction. The data used for this project is the StackOverFlow Developer Salary 2023. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/developer_salary_2023.git
cd developer_salary_2023
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Load the data into a Jupyter Notebook and perform exploratory data analysis.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('stackoverflow_developer_survey_2023.csv')

# Print the first five rows of the data
df.head()

# Check the shape of the data
df.shape

# Check the data types of each feature
df.dtypes

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()

# Plot the distribution of salaries
sns.distplot(df['Salary'])

# Plot the relationship between years of experience and salary
sns.scatterplot(x='Years of Experience', y='Salary', data=df)

# Plot the relationship between country and salary
sns.boxplot(x='Country', y='Salary', data=df)
```

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by removing outliers, imputing missing values, and encoding categorical features.

```
# Remove outliers
df = df[(df['Salary'] >
